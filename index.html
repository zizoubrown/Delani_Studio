        <h3>SERVICES</h3>
        <p>Before we write a line of code, our team will spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.</p>

                    <p>Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, 
                    the products we build are always ready to go live. 
                    This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.</p>
